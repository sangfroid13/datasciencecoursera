This repository contains the R code and a tidy dataset as part of the week 4 assignment of the 'Getting And Cleaning Data' course offered by JHU on Coursera.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

For this assignment, the 3 files in the train folder and the test folder were column bound to create 2 intermediate files in each folder separately. Thereafter, these two files were bound together by rows to create a merged data set.
The files in the train folder are:
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training activity labels.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

The files in the test folder are:

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test activity labels.

- 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

From the merged dataset, only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement has been extracted. (This has been done by looking up the strings "mean" and "std" in  features file and then mapping it onto the merged dataset to extract only those columns.) Following this operation, the new dataset now contains the following variables.

The activity file in the zipped dataset is used to get the activity labels and the merged dataset is accordingly replaced with these categorical data. 

Finally, a second, independent tidy data set is created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
